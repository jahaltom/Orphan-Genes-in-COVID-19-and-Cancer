**AccuracyTable.py:** Takes in RIA output and using metadata with self reported ethnicity generates accuracy table.Will contain accuracy for each study, overall for each superpopulaiton, and overall across all superpopulations.


**ChrAccuracyBarplot.py:** Takes output from AccuracyTable.py and makes a chr vs accuracy barplot.

**AccuracyByTissueBarPlot.py:** Takes in RIA output and using metadata with self reported ethnicity generates a tissue/etnicity vs accuracy barplot.

**Metadata_UniqMapReads_SNPS.py:** Takes output from TotalSNPsByRun and TotalUniqMapReadsByRun, along with RIA output and using metadata with self reported ethnicity generates a scatterplot of # of UniqMapReads/sample vs (yes,no)accuracy. Seperated by ethnicity. Does the same for Total SNPs/sample.
